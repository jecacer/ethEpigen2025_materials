## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("rtracklayer", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("rtracklayer")
if (!requireNamespace("R.utils", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("R.utils")

library(rtracklayer)
library(R.utils)
```


```{r}
url <- "https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF653YVR/@@download/ENCFF653YVR.bed.gz"
destfile <- "p300.bed.gz"

# Check if the compressed file already exists
if (!file.exists("p300.bed")) {
    download.file(url, destfile = destfile, mode = "wb")  # 'mode = "wb"' for binary files
    gunzip(destfile, remove = FALSE)  # Keep the original compressed file
} else {
    message("File 'p300.bed' already exists. Skipping download and extraction.")
}

# Import the file
p300 <- rtracklayer::import("p300.bed", format = "narrowPeak")

# Display the first few rows of the imported data
head(p300)

```
