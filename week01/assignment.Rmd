```


```{r}
install.packages(c("gsl","ggplot2","remotes","rmarkdown","UpSetR"))
# If you haven't install Bioconductor yet:
# install.packages("BiocManager")
# BiocManager::install()

BiocManager::install(c("GenomicRanges", "rtracklayer", "EnrichedHeatmap", "AnnotationHub", 
                       "ensembldb", "edgeR", "esATAC", "sechm", "motifmatchr","rGREAT",
